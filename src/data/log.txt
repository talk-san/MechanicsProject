WITHOUT ASSOCIATOR

For FILE: ute-s-92.stu
Slots: 10
Courses: 184
Iters: 1

When initially loading the set we see that the second there are only a few green lines
indicating that there are only a few courses that have no clashes

using the Print button we can see which ones don't have clashes:
    Exam	Slot	Clashes
    27	0	0
    46	0	0
    102 0   0
    105	0	0
    111	0	0
    ...
    133	0	0

Now let's start the algorithm with Shift = 1, this means we're shifting each course to the right,
after which more green lines appear, indicating some of the clashes were resolved, using the print
function:
    Exam	Slot	Clashes
    ...
    27	0	0
    28	0	0
    ...
    41	0	0
    ...
    46	0	0
    ...
    124	0	0
    125	0	0
    126	0	0
    ...

In comparison when starting the algorithm with 10 shifts, courses have more space to work with, this
results in a noticeably change in the graph, with now most lines being green and using the print
functionality we can find the lines which still haves clashes:
    98	10	1 with one clash
    123	10	1 with one clash

WITH AUTOASSOCIATOR

Since the hopfield implementation has some randomness to it the results below might not be
reproduced but here are my results:

Running the same configuration with the Autoassociator updates (default now) shows that with
the autoassociator updates with shift = 1 and same config we see much less clashes
for example the first clash free exam is now in my case much more green lines appear
in the second half of the drawing and there are some more courses
with no clashes in the print.

With shift = 1 and 100 iterations:
Shift = 1	Min clashes = 1452	at step 1

With shift = 1 and 100 iterations:
Shift = 1	Min clashes = 478	at step 22

With shift = 10 and 1 iteration using the chain update almost solves the problem with there being only a few
red lines that still need to be fixed:
