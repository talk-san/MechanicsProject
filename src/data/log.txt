WITHOUT ASSOCIATOR

For FILE: ute-s-92.stu
Slots: 10
Courses: 184
Iters: 1

When initially loading the set we see that the second there are only a few green lines
indicating that there are only a few courses that have no clashes

using the Print button we can see which ones don't have clashes:
    Exam	Slot	Clashes
    27	0	0
    46	0	0
    102 0   0
    105	0	0
    111	0	0
    ...
    133	0	0

Now let's start the algorithm with Shift = 1, this means we're shifting each course to the right,
after which more green lines appear, indicating some of the clashes were resolved, using the print
function:
    Exam	Slot	Clashes
    ...
    27	0	0
    28	0	0
    ...
    41	0	0
    ...
    46	0	0
    ...
    124	0	0
    125	0	0
    126	0	0
    ...

In comparison when starting the algorithm with 10 shifts, courses have more space to work with, this
results in a noticeably change in the graph, with now most lines being green and using the print
functionality we can find the lines which still haves clashes:
    98	10	1 with one clash
    123	10	1 with one clash

WITH AUTOASSOCIATOR

Since the hopfield implementation has some randomness to it the results below might not be
reproduced but here are my results:

Running the same configuration with the Autoassociator updates (default now) shows that with
the autoassociator updates with shift = 1 and same config we see much less clashes since
a lot of the courses have been moved to the second section without clashes
for example the first clash free exam is now in my case (17	8	0) and there are some more courses
with no clashes in the print.

With shift = 10 the start method doesn't change much from the version without the associator but
the problem is solved after 10 shift and a few steps, on one instance I got the following solution:
Exam	Slot	Clashes
