WITHOUT ASSOCIATOR

When initially loading the set we see that the second half of the graph is entirely green
indicating that there are no clashes with the second half of the courses,

In the first half there are only a few green lines, meaning most of the courses here have clashes,
using the Print button we can see which ones don't have clashes:
    27	0	0
    46	0	0
    105	0	0
    111	0	0
    ...
    133	0	0

Now let's start the algorithm with Shift = 1, this means we're shifting each course to the right,
after which more green lines appear in the first half, indicating some of the clashes were resolved,

In comparison when starting the algorithm with 10 shifts, courses have more space to work with, this
results in a noticeably change in the graph, with now most lines being green and using the print
functionality we can find the lines which still haves clashes:
    98	10	1 with one clash
    123	10	1 with one clash

WITH AUTOASSOCIATOR

Running the same configuration with the autoassociator updates (default now) shows that with
the autoassociator updates with shift = 1 and same config we see much less clashes since
a lot of the courses have been moved to the second section without clashes
for example the first clash free exam is now 15	14	0 and there are much less clashes now.

With shift = 10 the start method doesn't change much from the version without the associator but
the problem is solved after 1 shift with there being only 2 clashes after.
